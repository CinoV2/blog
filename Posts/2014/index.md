Package management to the build process, handling everything including HTML, JS, CSS, images, and fonts.

Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More Valued
http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/

5 mins of non comfort for 10 000$. Would you do it? Would you prepare for it? Why don’t you the same for negotiating salary?

You can trivially pick up $5,000 in salary negotiations just by sucking less.

Negotiating is not for country markets, successful people negotiate.

Company is used to it and well prepared, prepare yourself too.

Establish a reputation.

Negotiating never makes (worthwhile) offers worse.

Do not start negotiating until you already have a Yes-If.

Never Give A Number First. Never.
