## How not to be ashamed to ask for money
~ Zdenek Fidler

Who is typically asking for money?
* Startup from investor
* Company from customer
* Emplyee from emplyer

First impression is most important - prepare yourself precisely for it.

> You cannot accomplish what others can promise

### Asking Investor

Distinguish yourself. Capture attention.

Prepare business plan in short and interesting form - max range 1 A4 paper.

Prepare estimated time to gain profit.

Go alone or with other two - show enthusiasm.

Recoverability do not need to be just financial.

### Asking Customer

Utility value, expectation.

Relationship with customer. Personal attitude.

Has customer the right to demand changes?

To refuse a customer doesn't have to be necessary bad thing to your business.

Customer is king, but also say no and keep your attitude and virtue.

### Job listing slang

* Proactive - says yes to everything
* Flexible - works anytime and anywhere
* Dynamic team - full team of young noobs.

## 10 000 followeru
~ David Grudl

Think about how twitter works, examine single tweets.

Analyze what work (get reactions) and what not - negativism, FollowFriday, bragging.

Be funny or pretty.

Reasons to be followed:
- collector of followers (filatelista)
- Ego boost
- wide impact of message

Number of followers ~ only guide. Depends on structure of them.

Do not adapt to followers, be yourself. Find your audience.

Tweet what you would say in the pub, with friends.

Tweet truth, but you can little enhance it (like in pub, no more). Twitter is one big pub.

Let tweet mature, do not tweet in urge. Delay. Cold head.

Find the right timing for tweet.

Unfollow can insult, so follow advisedly.

Right tweets to be easy shareable, retweetable.

Have nice timeline, do not loose hardly gained attention.

#### How to get followers
* appear in mentions
* start to follow sb -> notification
* use popular hashtag
* arrange retweet
* pretty avatar
* have a nice timeline

## Jak funguje networking v Americe aneb jak získat z konference maximum!
~ Aleš Vyka – http://blog.vyka.eu

Join conferences, make contacts, gain maximum.

Conferences take a lot of time, make a maximum from it.

Talk story with partners, talk money with managers.

Be prepared to make offer at place, be prepare to make a deal immediately.

Make notes on back side of business card.

Make contact (with even small effort - email, twitter) with everyone you have met.

Go to conferences to meet new people, go to pub to chat with present friends.

Make an effort, do not be too cosy. Speak to new people.

We are all just humans. Do not be ashamed.

Give same amount of effort to develop as networking (marketing).

Use new knowledge immediately.

Really **study** how to make presentation.

Wear badges with name, logo and interest. Promote your interest visually, stand out.

Make more money on conferences than you spend.

Talk about your plans.

## Responsive design a korporátní web
~ Tomáš Peterka – @atheiste

Story about Vodafone online activities and its mobile redesign.

Vodafone site divided to channels: Samoobsluha, eShop, Centrum péče, Vodafone park, ČiliChilli, Mobilní aplikace, Sociální média.

Each channel has its own visual guidelines.

Vodafone is enterprise, it has process guidelines and templates almost for everything.


## Z místa A do místa B se nedostanete
~ Martin Kopta – @atpok

Do not design from just your perspective.

For some services, users are not ready yet - buying music in Czech Republic.

Forcing design - teach users what to do by forcing them, and not allow them to do bad things.

Users already have experiences with web and expect some behavior. You can't create innovative product, that is intuitive at the same time.

Intuitiveness - immediate feedback is very important.


## Kreativita obsahu - je to cool, je to zábava a sem tam to i něco prodá
~ Roman Hřebecký

You can sell everything, but you have to have good story.


## Osobní zpověď copywritera v ČR: Jak se mu žije, pracuje a vydělává?
~ Jan Ambrož

http://copywriter.cz

There are few people that work exclusively as copywriters.

Some people won't understand why your job is important and won't help you.

School certificate - show that you can work with information, people and byrocracy.

Have humbleness to people you write for - tell them what they do wrong, but do not be arrogant.

Hard to report working time.


## Gamifikace - hrou k vyšší produktivitě i vědeckému výzkumu
~ Jan Vlček – @vlki

In games, our lives are more interesting, more challenging.

Gamifikace - use of game elements in non-game environment.


## HTML5 & hry
~ Lukáš Franěk

Canvas - render primitives.

Watch for browser performance.

WebStorage - setItem(), removeItem(), clear(). Only string. No expiration. Can assign event handers (eg. value change).

WebSocket - real-time connection to server.


## Socialnim idiotem snadno a rychle

Working alone – Degradation of social skills.
