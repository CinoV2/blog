#### Notes On AngularJS Scope Life-Cycle
http://onehungrymind.com/notes-on-angularjs-scope-life-cycle/

The $apply() method, which is what you call when you are transitioning from non-angular world into angular world, calls $digest()

Knockout dependency tracking is a clever feature for a problem which angular does not have.

dirty-checking allows you to do POJO, whereas KO and backbone force you to inherit from their classes, and access your data through accessors.

video games and GPUs use the dirty-checking approach, specifically because it is consistent

$digest processes all the watchExpressions for the current scope and its children.

Organize code – compare with plain jQuery.

That code doesn’t break, doesn’t mean it works.

It’s possible to integrate into legacy apps.

Angular will impress you even after few years.
