War room at work.

Human are pretty weird, we don’t read, we are easily manipulated, …

Open sourcing internal stuff is good for discipline.

### Rapid prototyping

Axure, Balsamiq, InVision (collaborate with public)


### Javascript templating

* Freemarker has bad performance on big scale, needed to switched back to JSP.

***

Node is great for fast mock API.

Test on real devices early & often.

Time-tracking is extra baggage for programmers.

Client vs Server – it depends.

Do what make sense on client.

App vs page, on size doesn’t fit all.


#### Native vs web

All existing web technologies (analytics, a/b testing, delivery options) you have to reinvent.

PhoneGap, Cordova to bridge these two technologies.  


#### Lean UX Antipatterns

Do not work with genius designer.

Do not kill collaboration by separate tribes in team.

Do not underestimate properly train newcommers. fda fda Hello

Do not work with naysayers.

Be nice, but sincere.

Work isolate from time to time, but do not lose collaboration.

Have clear decision makers in each discipline (engineering, designers, …)
